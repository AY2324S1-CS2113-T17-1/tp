# Project: AthletiCLI

## Overview

**AthletiCLI** is your all-in-one solution to track, analyse, and optimize your athletic performance. Designed for the
committed athlete, this command-line interface (CLI) tool not only keeps tabs on your physical activities but also
covers dietary habits, sleep metrics, and more.

### Features:

* **Diet Record Management**: Designed and implemented the adding, deleting, editing, listing, and finding of diet
  records.
* **Activity Goal Management**: Designed and implemented the deleting, editing, and listing of activity goals.
* **Common Parsing Functions**: Enhanced and refactored widely used `getValueForMarker`, `parseDateTime` and 
  `parseDate` functions to make them more robust and reusable.
* **Enhancements:**
  - Enhanced the `add-diet` feature, enabling the input of various data fields such as `calories`, `fat`, `carb`, 
    `protein`, `datetime` in any order.
  - Refined the `edit-diet` feature, allowing users to modify necessary data fields without altering the remaining data.

### Project Management

* Implemented features across versions 1.0, 2.0, and 2.1 incrementally, aligning with development plans.
* Utilized forking and branching for parallel development and seamless feature integration.
* Managed bugs effectively using issue tracking, improving project accuracy and reliability.
* Organized issue tracking by updating labels and assigning tasks, enhancing team efficiency.

### Documentation
* **User Guide:**
  * Added documentation for the features `add-diet`, `edit-diet`, `delete-diet`, `list-diet`, `find-diet`, 
    `edit-activity-goal`, `delete-activity-goal`, `list-activity-goal`.
  * Updated the `Command Summary`, `User Stories` sections regularly.
* **Developer Guide:**
  * Explained the implementation structure of adding, editing, deleting, listing and finding diets.
