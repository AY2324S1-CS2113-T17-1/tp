## Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Feature: Added the ability track and manage diets

* What it does: Allows the user to add diets to the application with a variety of parameters. Apart from the calories,
  protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake, the user can also add the date and time of the meal. Additionally, user can 
  edit, delete, list, and find diets.
* Justification: This feature is the core of the diet management as it allows the user to track their dietary habits. 
  It is also the basis for other features like the diet goal tracking.
* Highlights: The edit diet command allows the user to edit any parameter of a diet. It does not require the user to 
  enter all the parameters. The user can enter only the parameters that they want to edit. The implementation included
  regex to smartly parse the user input irrespective of the order of the parameters.
