### Features:

* **Diet Record Management**: Designed and implemented the adding, deleting, editing, listing, and finding of diet
  records.
* **Activity Goal Management**: Designed and implemented the deleting, editing, and listing of activity goals.
* **Common Parsing Functions**: Enhanced and refactored widely used `getValueForMarker`, `parseDateTime` and 
  `parseDate` functions to make them more robust and reusable.
* **Enhancements:**
  - Enhanced the `add-diet` feature, enabling the input of various data fields such as `calories`, `fat`, `carb`, 
    `protein`, `datetime` in any order.
  - Refined the `edit-diet` feature, allowing users to modify necessary data fields without altering the remaining data.

### Project Management
