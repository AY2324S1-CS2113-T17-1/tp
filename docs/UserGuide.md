## FAQ
  **Q: *Am I allowed to update the storage files?***

  **A**: 
  While it is generally advisable not to edit the contents of the storage file, you do have the option to make updates. 
  Please exercise caution when doing so. Incorrect edits to the storage file can result in data loss. If AthleticCLI 
  encounters incorrect format of the file contents, it will prompt you to exit using the 
  [bye](#exiting-athleticli) command. 
  Continuing with the program in such cases will lead to the deletion of all data in the file.
