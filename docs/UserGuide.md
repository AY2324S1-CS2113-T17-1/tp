## Features

**Notes about Command Format**

* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters provided by the user.
* Parameters need to be specified in the given order unless specified otherwise.
* Parameters enclosed in square brackets [] are optional.

**Notes about lack of Goal Delete for Sleep and Activity**

The absence of a "Goal Delete" feature for Sleep and Activity in the current version of AthletiCLI, while present for Diet, can be concisely justified as follows:

1. **Diversity of Diet Goals:** The Diet section likely encompasses a wider range of goals compared to Sleep and Activity. With such variability, users might frequently need to delete diet goals, making a delete function more essential in this section.

2. **Stability of Sleep and Activity Goals:** Goals related to sleep and activity are generally more consistent and less variable over time. This stability reduces the immediate need for a delete feature, as users are less likely to remove these goals frequently.

3. **Focused Development Resources:** Given limited development resources and time, the team prioritized implementing the delete feature for the Diet section, where it was deemed most necessary due to the larger volume and variability of goals.

4. **Planned for Future Implementation:** The absence of this feature in the current version for Sleep and Activity does not indicate it will never be implemented. It is planned for a future update, aligning with a phased development approach.

## FAQ
  **Q: *Am I allowed to update the storage files?***

  **A**: 
  While it is generally advisable not to edit the contents of the storage file, you do have the option to make updates. 
  Please exercise caution when doing so. Incorrect edits to the storage file can result in data loss. If AthleticCLI 
  encounters incorrect format of the file contents, it will prompt you to exit using the 
  [bye](#exiting-athleticli) command. 
  Continuing with the program in such cases will lead to the deletion of all data in the file.
