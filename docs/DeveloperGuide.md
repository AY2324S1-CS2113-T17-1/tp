## Design

This section provides a high-level explanation of the design and implementation of AthletiCLI, 
supported by UML diagrams and short code snippets to illustrate the flow of data and interactions between the 
components.


### Architecture

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`AthletiCLI`** is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

The bulk of the AthletiCLIâ€™s work is done by the following components, with each of them corresponds to a package:

* [`UI`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/ui): The UI and other UI-related sub-components of AthletiCLI.
* [`Parser`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/parser): Parses the commands input by the users.
* [`Storage`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [`Data`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/data): Holds the data of AthletiCLI in memory.
* [`Commands`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/commands): The command executors.

[`Exceptions`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/exceptions) represents exceptions used by multiple other components.

### Overview

The class diagram shows the relationship between `AthletiCLI`, `Ui`, `Parser`, and `Data`.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `help add-diet`.

![](images/HelpAddDiet.svg)

This diagram involves the interaction between `AthletiCLI`, `UI`, `Parser`, `Commands` components and the user.

The `Storage` component only interacts with the `Data` component. The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how they interact with each other for the scenario where a `save` command is executed.

For simplicity, only 1 `StorableList` is drawn instead of the actual 6.

## Implementation

### Diet Management in AthletiCLI

#### [Implemented] Setting Up, Editing, Deleting, Listing, and Finding Diets

Regardless of the operation you are performing on diets (setting up, editing, deleting, listing, or finding), the process follows a general five-step pattern in AthletiCLI:

1. **Input Processing**: The user's input is passed through AthletiCLI to the Parser Class. Examples of user inputs include:
    - `add-diet calories/500 protein/20 carb/50 fat/10 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00` for adding a diet.
    - `edit-diet 1 calories/500 protein/20 carb/50 fat/10 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00` for editing a diet.
    - `delete-diet 1` for deleting a diet.
    - `list-diet` for listing all diets.
    - `find-diet 2021-09-01` for finding diets of a particular date.

2. **Command Identification**: The Parser Class identifies the type of diet operation and passes the necessary parameters.

3. **Command Creation**: An instance of the corresponding command class is created (e.g., AddDietCommand, EditDietCommand, etc.) and returned to AthletiCLI.

4. **Command Execution**: AthletiCLI executes the command, interacting with the data instance of DietList to perform the required operation.

5. **Result Display**: A message is returned post-execution and passed through AthletiCLI to the UI for display to the user.

By following these general steps, AthletiCLI ensures a streamlined process for managing diet-related tasks.

#### [Implemented] Setting Up of Diet Goals

This following sequence diagram show how the 'set-diet-goal' command works:

<p  align="center" width="100%">
  <img width="80%" src="images/setDietGoalUmlSequenceDiagram.svg" alt="'set-diet-goal' Sequence Diagram"/>
</p>

**Step 1:** The input from the user ("set-diet-goal fats/1") runs through AthletiCLI to the Parser Class.

**Step 2:** The Parser Class will identify the request as setting up a diet goal and pass in the parameters
"fats/1".

**Step 3:** A temporary dietGoalList is created to store newly created diet goals.

**Step 4:** The inputs are verified against our lists of approved diet goals.

**Step 5:** For each of the diet goals that are valid, a dietGoal object will be created and stored in the 
temporary dietGoalList.

**Step 6:** The Parser then creates for an instance of SetDietGoalCommand and returns the instance to 
AthletiCLI.

**Step 7:** AthletiCLI will execute the SetDietGoalCommand. This adds the dietGoals that are present in the 
temporary list into the data instance of DietGoalList which will be kept for records.

**Step 8:** After executing the SetDietGoalCommand, SetDietGoalCommand returns a message that is passed to 
AthletiCLI to be passed to UI(not shown) for display.

#### [Proposed] Implementation of DietGoalList

The current implementation of DietGoalList is an ArrayList.
It helps to store dietGoals, however it is not efficient in searching for a particular dietGoal.
At any instance of time, there could only be the existence of one dietGoal.
Verifying if there is an existence of a dietGoal using an ArrayList takes O(n) time, where n is the number of dietGoals.
The proposed change will be to change the underlying data structure to a hashmap for amortised O(1) time complexity
for checking the presence of a dietGoal.


#### [Implemented] Adding activities
The `add-activity` feature allows users to add a new activity into the application.
These are the main components behind the architecture of the `add-activity` feature:
1. `AthletiCLI`: faciliates the mechanism. It captures the input and calls the parser and execution.
2. `Parser`: parses the user input and generates the appropriate command object and activity 
   instance.
3. `AddActivityCommand`: encapsulates the execution of the `add-activity` command. It adds 
   the activity to the data.
4. `Activity`: represents the activity that is to be added.
5. `Data`: holds current state of the activity list.
6. `ActivityList`: maintains the list of all added activities.

Here is a class diagram of the relationships between the data components `Activity`,`Data` and `ActivityList`:
(tbd)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1 - Input Capture:** The user issues an `add-activity ...` which is captured and passed to the Parser by the 
running AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 2 - Activity Parsing:** The Parser parses the raw input to obtain the arguments of the activity. Given that all 
parameters are provided correctly and no exception is thrown, a new activity object is created.

**Step 3 - Command Parsing:** In addition the parser will create an `AddActivityCommand` object with the newly added 
activity attached to it. The command implements the `AddActivityCommand#execute()` operation and is passed to 
the AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 4 - Activity Addition:** The AthletiCLI instance executes the `AddActivityCommand` object. The command will 
access the data and retrieve the currently stored list of activities stored inside it. The new `Activity` object is 
added to the list.

**Step 5 - User Interaction:** Once the activity is successfully added, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add-activity` operation works:

#### [Implemented] Tracking activity goals

With the `set-activity-goal` feature, users can set periodic goals for their activities.
The fulfillment of these goals is tracked automatically and can be evaluated by the user at any time.

These are the key components and their roles in the architecture of the goal tracking:
* `SetActivityGoalCommand`: encapsulates the execution of the `set-activity-goal` command. It adds 
  the activity goal to the data.
* `ActivityGoal`: represents the activity goal that is to be added and contains functionality to 
  track the fulfillment of the goal. 
* `ActivityList`: contains key functionality to retrieve and filter the activity list according to the specified 
  properties of the goal.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the goal setting and tracking mechanism behaves at 
each step.

1. **Step 1 - Input Capture:** The user issues a `set-activity-goal ...` which is captured and passed to the 
   Parser by the running AthletiCLI instance.
2. **Step 2 - Goal Parsing:** The Parser parses the raw input to obtain the sports, target and timespan of the goal. 
   Given that all these parameters are provided correctly and no exception is thrown, a new activity goal object is 
   created.
3. **Step 3 - Command Parsing:** In addition the parser will create a `SetActivityGoalCommand` object with the newly 
   added activity goal attached to it. The command implements the `SetActivityGoalCommand#execute()` operation and is 
   passed to the AthletiCLI instance.
4. **Step 4 - Goal Addition:** The AthletiCLI instance executes the `SetActivityGoalCommand` object. The command will 
   access the data and retrieve the currently stored list of activity goals stored inside it. The new `ActivityGoal` 
   object is added to the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `set-activity-goal` operation works:
<p  align="center" >
  <img width="100%" src="images/AddActivityGoal.svg" alt="Sequence Diagram of set-activity-goal"/>
</p>

Assume that the user has set a goal to run 10km per week and has already tracked two running activities of 5km each.
The following describes how the goal evaluation works after being invoked by the user, e.g., with a list-activity-goal command:

5. **Step 5 - Goal Evaluation:** The evaluation of the goal is operated by the `ActivityGoal` object. It retrieves the 
activity list with the two tracked activities from the data and calls the total distance calculation function. It filters the 
   activity list according to the specified timespan and sports of the goal. The current value obtained by this, 
   10km in the example, is returned to the `ActivityGoal` object, which then compares it to the target value of the goal. This mechanism is visualized in the following sequence diagram:

<p  align="center" >
    <img width="100%" src="images/ActivityGoalEvaluation.svg" alt="Sequence Diagram of activity goal evaluation"/>
</p>

### Sleep Management in AthletiCLI

#### [Implemented] Finding, Adding, Editing, Deleting, Listing Sleep

1. **Input Processing**: The user's input is passed through AthletiCLI to the Parser Class. Examples of user inputs include:
    - "add-sleep hours/8 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00" for adding sleep.
    - "edit-sleep 1 hours/8 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00" for editing sleep.
    - "delete-sleep 1" for deleting sleep.
    - "list-sleep" for listing all sleep.

2. **Command Identification**: The Parser Class identifies the type of sleep operation and passes the necessary parameters.

3. **Command Creation**: An instance of the corresponding command class is created (e.g., AddSleepCommand, EditSleepCommand, etc.) and returned to AthletiCLI.

4. **Command Execution**: AthletiCLI executes the command, interacting with the data instance of SleepList to perform the required operation.

5. **Result Display**: A message is returned post-execution and passed through AthletiCLI to the UI for display to the user.

The following class diagram shows how sleep and sleep-related classes are constructed in AthletiCLI:
