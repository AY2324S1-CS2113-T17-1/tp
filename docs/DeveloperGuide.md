## Setting Up and Getting Started

First, fork [this repo](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp), and clone the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use IntelliJ IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [se-edu/guides IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure IntelliJ is configured to use JDK 11.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide
[se-edu/guides IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)
to import the project into IDEA.

   :exclamation: **Note:** Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
3. **Verify the setup**:
   * Run `athlethicli.AthletiCLI` and try a few commands.
   * Run the tests using `./gradlew check` and ensure they all pass.

### Architecture

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<img width="200em" src="images/architectureDiagram.svg" alt="'set-diet-goal' Sequence Diagram"/>

**Main components of the architecture**

[`AthletiCLI`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/athleticli/AthletiCLI.java) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

The bulk of the AthletiCLIâ€™s work is done by the following components, with each of them corresponds to a package:

* [`Ui`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/ui): Interacts with the user via the command line.
* [`Parser`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/parser): Parses the commands input by the users.
* [`Storage`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/storage): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [`Data`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/data): Holds the data of AthletiCLI in memory.
* [`Commands`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/commands): Contains multiple command executors.

Other components:

* [`Exceptions`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/exceptions): Represents exceptions used by multiple other components.
* [`Common`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/athleticli/common): Contains configurations that shared by other components.

### Overview

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `help add-diet`.

![](images/HelpAddDiet.svg)

This diagram involves the interaction between `AthletiCLI`, `Ui`, `Parser`, `Commands` components and the user.

The `Storage` component only interacts with the `Data` component. The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how they interact with each other for the scenario where a `save` command is executed.

![](images/Save.svg)

For simplicity, only 1 `StorableList` is drawn instead of the actual 6.

## Implementation

### Diet Management in AthletiCLI

#### [Implemented] Adding, Editing, Deleting, Listing, and Finding Diets

Regardless of the operation you are performing on diets (adding, editing, deleting, listing, or finding), the process
follows a general five-step pattern in AthletiCLI:

**Step 1 - Input Processing:** The user's input is passed through AthletiCLI to the `Parser` class. Examples of user
inputs include:

- `add-diet calories/500 protein/20 carb/50 fat/10 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00` for adding a diet.
- `edit-diet 1 calories/500 protein/20 carb/50 fat/10 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00` for editing a diet at index 1.
- `delete-diet 1` for deleting a diet at index 1.
- `list-diet` for listing all diets.
- `find-diet 2021-09-01` for finding all diets on 1st September 2021.

**Step 2 - Command Identification:** The `Parser` class identifies the type of diet operation and calls the
appropriate `DietParser` method to parse the necessary parameters (if any). For example, the `add-diet` command will
call the `DietParser#parseDiet()` method, which will return a `Diet` object.

**Step 3 - Command Creation**: An instance of the corresponding command class is created (e.g., `AddDietCommand`,
`EditDietCommand`, etc.) using the returned object (if any) from the `DietParser` and returned to AthletiCLI.

**Step 4 - Command Execution**: AthletiCLI executes the command, interacting with the data instance of DietList to
perform the required operation. For example, the `AddDietCommand` will add the `Diet` object to the `DietList` object,
while the `EditDietCommand` will edit the `Diet` object at the specified index in the `DietList` object.

**Step 5 - Result Display**: A message is returned post-execution and passed through AthletiCLI to the UI for
display to the user. This is useful for informing the user of the success or failure of the operation.

By following these general steps, AthletiCLI ensures a streamlined process for managing diet-related tasks.

Here is the sequence diagram for the `edit-diet` command to illustrate the five-step process:

![](images/editDietSequenceDiagram.png)

> The diagram shows the interaction between the `AthletiCLI`, `Parser`, `Command`, and `Data` components.
> The use of HashMaps in the `DietParser` class allows for a more flexible and extensible design, as it facilitates
> the modification of necessary parameters without requiring the user to specify all parameters in the command. For 
> example, the user can choose to edit only the calories and protein of a diet, without specifying the carb and fat values.


#### [Implemented] Setting Up of Diet Goals

This following sequence diagram show how the 'set-diet-goal' command works:

![](images/DietGoalsSequenceDiagram.svg)

**Step 1:** The input from the user ("set-diet-goal WEEKLY fat/1") runs through AthletiCLI to the Parser Class.

**Step 2:** The Parser Class will identify the request as setting up a diet goal and pass in the parameters
"WEEKLY fat/1".

**Step 3:** A temporary dietGoalList is created to store newly created diet goals. In this case, a weekly healthy goal 
for fat with a target value of 1mg.

**Step 4:** The inputs are validated against our lists of approved diet goals.

**Step 5:** For each of the diet goals that are valid, if it is a healthy goal, a HealthyDietGoal object will be created and stored in the 
temporary dietGoalList, else an UnhealthyDietGoal will be created instead.

**Step 6:** The Parser then creates for an instance of SetDietGoalCommand and returns the instance to 
AthletiCLI.

**Step 7:** AthletiCLI will execute the SetDietGoalCommand. This adds the dietGoals that are present in the 
temporary list into the data instance of DietGoalList which will be kept for records.

**Step 8:** After executing the SetDietGoalCommand, SetDietGoalCommand returns a message that is passed to 
AthletiCLI to be passed to UI(not shown) for display.

#### [Proposed] Future Implementation of DietGoalList Class

The current implementation of DietGoalList is an ArrayList. This is because the number of nutrients currently is 4. O(n^2)
operations can be treated as O(1). Furthermore, DietGoalListClass gets to inherits from superclass like its other goals' counterpart.
However, it is not efficient in searching for a particular dietGoal especially when the number of goals and time span for goals increases.
At any instance of time, there could only be the existence of one dietGoal.
Verifying if there is an existence of a diet goal using an ArrayList takes O(n) time, where n is the number of dietGoals.
The proposed change will be to change the underlying data structure to a hashmap in the future for amortised O(1) time complexity
for checking the presence of a dietGoal.

### Activity Management in AthletiCLI

#### [Implemented] Adding activities

The `add-activity` feature is a core functionality which allows users to record new activities in the application.
The feature is designed in a modular and extendable way, ensuring seamless integration of future enhancements and 
especially new activity types.

The architecture of the `add-activity` feature is composed of the following main components.
1. `AthletiCLI`: Facilitates the mechanism. It captures the user input and initiates the parsing and execution.
2. `Parser` (`Activity Parser`): Interprets the user input, generating both the appropriate command object and 
   the activity instance.
3. `AddActivityCommand`: Encapsulates the execution of the `add-activity` command, adding the activity to the data.
4. `ActivityChanges`: Contains the arguments of the activity to be added. It is used to transfer the data from the 
   parser to the activity in a modular way.
5. `Activity`: Represents the activity to be added. It is a superclass for specific activity types like Run, Swim and 
   Cycle.
6. `Data`: Manages the current state of the activity list.
7. `ActivityList`: Maintains the list of all activities added to the application.


Class Relationships:

Below is a class diagram illustrating the relationships between the data components `Activity`,`Data` and 
`ActivityList`:

<img width="400em" src="images/ActivityInheritance.svg" alt="Activity Data Components"/>

> The diagram shows the inheritance relationship between the `Activity` class and the specific activity types `Run`, 
> `Swim` and `Cycle`, each with unique attributes and methods. This design becomes especially crucial in future 
> development cycles with added parameters and activity types. The `ActivityList` aggregates these instances.

Usage Scenario and Process Flow:

The process of adding an activity involves several steps, each handled by different components.
Given below is an example usage scenario on how the add mechanism behaves.

**Step 1 - Input Capture:** The user issues an `add-activity ...` (or `add-run`, etc.) command which is 
captured and forwarded to the Parser by the running AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 2 - Activity Parsing:** The ActivityParser interprets the raw input to obtain the arguments of the activity. 
Given that all parameters are provided correctly and no exception is thrown, a new activity object is created.

This diagram illustrates the activity parsing process in more detail:
The `ActivityChanges` object plays a key role in the parsing process. It is used for storing the 
different attributes of the activity that are to be added. Later, the `ActivityParser` 
will use the `ActivityChanges` to create the `Activity` object. 
> This way of transferring data between the parser and the activity is more flexible which is suitable for future
> extensions of the activity types and allows for a more modular design. This design and most of the methods can be reused
> for the `edit-activity` mechanism, which works in the same way with slight modifications due to optional parameters.

<p align="center" >
  <img width="100%" src="images/ActivityParsing.svg" alt="Activity Parsing Process"/>
</p>

**Step 3 - Command Parsing:** Afterwards the parser constructs an `AddActivityCommand` embedding the newly created 
activity within it. The `AddActivityCommand` implements the `AddActivityCommand#execute()` operation and is passed to 
the AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 4 - Activity Addition:** The AthletiCLI instance executes the `AddActivityCommand` object. The command 
accesses the data and retrieves the currently stored list of activities stored inside it. The new `Activity` object is 
then added to the `ActivityList`.

**Step 5 - User Interaction:** Upon successful addition of the activity, a confirmation message is displayed to the 
user.

The following sequence diagram visually represents the flow and interactions of components during the `add-activity` 
operation:

![](images/AddActivity.svg)

#### [Implemented] Tracking activity goals

The `set-activity-goal` feature allows users to set and track periodic goals for their activities.
The goal fulfillment is automatically monitored and can be reviewed by the user at any time.

These are the key components and their roles in the architecture of the goal tracking:
* `SetActivityGoalCommand`: Encapsulates the execution of the `set-activity-goal` command. It adds 
  the activity goal to the data.
* `ActivityGoal`: Represents the activity goal that is to be added and contains functionality to 
  track the fulfillment of the goal. 
* `ActivityList`: Contains key functionality to retrieve and filter the activity list according to the specified 
  criteria of the goal.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the goal setting and tracking mechanism behaves at 
each step.

**Step 1 - Input Capture:** The user issues a `set-activity-goal ...` command which is captured and passed to the 
   Parser by the running AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 2 - Goal Parsing:** The `ActivityParser` parses the raw input to obtain the sports, target and timespan of the 
   goal. 
   Given that all these parameters are provided correctly and no exception is thrown, a new activity goal object is 
   created.

**Step 3 - Command Parsing:** In addition the parser will create a `SetActivityGoalCommand` object with the newly 
   added activity goal attached to it. The command implements the `SetActivityGoalCommand#execute()` operation and is 
   passed to the AthletiCLI instance.

**Step 4 - Goal Addition:** The AthletiCLI instance executes the `SetActivityGoalCommand` object. The command will 
   access the data and retrieve the currently stored list of activity goals stored inside it. The new `ActivityGoal` 
   object is added to the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `set-activity-goal` operation works:

![](images/AddActivityGoal.svg)

Assume that the user has set a goal to run 10km per week and has already tracked two running activities of 5km each 
within the last 7 days as well as three older sport activities. The object diagram below shows the state of the 
scenario with the eligible activities for the goal highlighted in green.

![](images/ActivityObjectDiagram.svg)

The following describes how the goal evaluation works after being invoked by the user, e.g., with a `list-activity-goal` command:

**Step 5 - Goal Assessment:** The evaluation of the goal is operated by the `ActivityGoal` object. It retrieves the 
activity list with the five tracked activities from the data and calls the total distance calculation function. It 
   filters the activity list according to the specified timespan and sports of the goal. The current value obtained by this, 
   10km in the example, is returned to the `ActivityGoal` object. This output is compared to the target value of the 
   goal. This mechanism is visualized in the following sequence diagram:

![](images/ActivityGoalEvaluation.svg)

The `edit-activity-goal` and `delete-activity-goal` operations function similarly. They use the arguments `sport`,
`type`, and `period` to identify the specific goal to be edited or deleted. If there is no existing goal that
matches the specified criteria, an error message is displayed to the user.

Similar to `set-activity-goal`, the operations `edit-activity-goal` and `delete-activity-goal` utilize
`ActivityGoal` objects to represent the goals being edited or deleted. During the execution of these commands, the
system quickly verifies whether the goal exists in the `ActivityGoalList`. If the goal is found, it is then edited
or deleted as requested.

Finally, the `list-activity-goal` operation is designed similarly to the `list-activity` operation. It involves
retrieving the `ActivityGoalList` from the database and displaying the goals to the user.

### Sleep Management in AthletiCLI

#### [Implemented] Finding, Adding, Editing, Deleting, Listing Sleep

1. **Input Processing**: The user's input is passed through AthletiCLI to the Parser Class. Examples of user inputs include:
    - "add-sleep hours/8 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00" for adding sleep.
    - "edit-sleep 1 hours/8 datetime/2021-09-01 06:00" for editing sleep.
    - "delete-sleep 1" for deleting sleep.
    - "list-sleep" for listing all sleep.

2. **Command Identification**: The Parser Class identifies the type of sleep operation and passes the necessary parameters.

3. **Command Creation**: An instance of the corresponding command class is created (e.g., AddSleepCommand, EditSleepCommand, etc.) and returned to AthletiCLI.

4. **Command Execution**: AthletiCLI executes the command, interacting with the data instance of SleepList to perform the required operation.

5. **Result Display**: A message is returned post-execution and passed through AthletiCLI to the UI for display to the user.

In particular to demonstrate all parser classes, the following sequence diagram shows how the `edit-sleep` command works:

![](images/EditSleepObjectSequenceDiagram.svg)

The sleep parser was originally designed with little modularity, with each sleep instruction having to be parsed individually. This resulted in a lot of code duplication and was not very modular. This also resulted in having to reimplement much of the input checking logic for each sleep instruction, and many different error messages that was difficult to maintain. 

Therefore a refactoring was done such that we only have a sleep object parser, sleep index parser and sleep goal parser that interacts with the sleep parser. This allows us to reuse the input checking logic and error messages. This also allows us to have a more modular design and reduce code duplication.


#### [Implemented] Sleep Structure

The following class diagram demonstrates the relationship between the data components Sleep, SleepList, as well as the Findable interface and the StorableList abstract class.

![](images/SleepAndSleepListClassDiagram.svg)

The design decision for why we have decided to implement a findable interface and a storable list abstract class is to have a more modular design. Therefore allowing for easier extension of the code in the future when implementing other data classes as well, such as extending to hydration and other possible data classes.

#### [Implemented] Sleep Duration and Date calculation

Initially sleep entries do not have an associated date, this makes it much more difficult to find the sleep entries for a specific date. Therefore we have decided to add a date field to the sleep entries. 

However, there are complications surrounding calculation of sleep date. Many people often sleep past midnight, and this results in the sleep date being the next day instead of the current day. Therefore we have decided that for sleeps starting before 06:00 on the next day, the sleep date will be the previous day. This allows us to have a more accurate representation of the sleep date.

**[Challenge]**

Initially, the design of the sleep duration used integer to store the seconds of the sleep duration. However, this design results in much difficulty when it comes to the calculation of the sleep duration. 

For instance, when printing the sleep duration string, we have to convert the seconds into hours, minutes and seconds. This results in a lot of code duplication and is not very modular.

**[Solution]**

Therefore we have decided to change the design of the sleep duration to use the Duration class from the Java library. This allows us to use the built-in functions to calculate the sleep duration and convert the sleep duration into a string. This results in a more modular design and reduces code duplication.

#### [Implemented] Sleep Goals

The sleep goals feature allows users to set and track periodic goals for their sleep duration.

The implementation of sleep goals is similar to the implementation of activity goals. Therefore the implementation of sleep goals is not described in detail here.

**[Future Implementation]**
For Sleep Goals originally there were plans to incorporate a sleep quality goal where an optimum sleep start time and end time would be set. However, due to issues surrounding modular design, and how we will have to extend our common Goal interface and abstract classes to include more methods, we have decided to not implement this feature. It will be implemented in a future version of AthletiCLI.

     * There is a daily healthy calories goal present.
     * `set-diet-goal DAILY calories/500` will result in an error since the goal is already present.
   * Test case 4:
     * There is a daily healthy calories goal present.
     * `set-diet-goal DAILY unhealthy calories/500` will result in an error as a nutrient goal cannot be healthy 
     and unhealthy at the same time.

     or the value is greater than the number of diet goals present in the diet goal records, error will be thrown.
4. Editing diet goals
   * This is similar to setting diet goal, but the goal is required to be in the diet goals record first.
   * Users are only allowed to edit the target value of the goal. There is no edit supported to edit diet goal 
   types or diet goal time span.
   * Test case 1:
     * No goals present in the records.
     * `edit-diet-goal WEEKLY calories/5000` will return an error since there are no associated goals to 
     make an edit to the goal's target value.
   * Test case 2: 
     * Weekly healthy calories goal is present with a target value of 20.
     * `edit-diet-goal WEEKLY calories/5000` will update the target value of weekly healthy calories goal to 5000.
   * Similar to setting diet goals, the weekly goal values should always be greater than the daily goal values.
